## Working with data

This project attempts to find a pattern with some sample data

## Import data

My data were imported from `dplyr::starwars`{=}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

my_raw_data <- read_csv("data/raw/my_raw_data.csv")
```

## Wrangle data

I subsetted my data by eliminating any character that does not have an assigned sex characteristic.

```{r}
my_data <- my_raw_data |> 
  filter(sex == "none")

# export cleaned data
my_data |> 
  write_csv("data/clean/clean_data.csv")
```

## Visualize

I want to plot the remaining data.

```{r}
my_data |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  ggplot(aes(height, mass)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = gender)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = name), nudge_x = 2, nudge_y = 2) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "My scatter plot title")
```
