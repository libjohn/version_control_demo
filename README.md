### **Project Title: Investigating the Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Ecosystems**

> NOTE: The main analysis file can be found in `scripts/index.qmd`

**Project Overview:** This research project aims to investigate the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems, specifically focusing on sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and their combined impact on marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

**Research Questions:**

1.  How is sea-level rise affecting coastal habitats, such as salt marshes and mangroves?

2.  What are the implications of ocean acidification for marine organisms, particularly shellfish and coral reefs?

3.  How do the combined effects of sea-level rise and ocean acidification influence coastal ecosystem resilience and productivity?

**Methodology:**

-   **Literature Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on climate change impacts in coastal ecosystems.

-   **Field Studies:** Collect data through field observations, sampling, and monitoring of coastal habitats.

-   **Modeling:** Utilize computer models to simulate future climate scenarios and predict potential impacts on coastal ecosystems.

-   **Statistical Analysis:** Employ statistical methods to analyze collected data and identify trends and correlations.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**

-   **Field Data:** Collect data on sea-level rise, ocean temperature, salinity, pH, and biological indicators (e.g., species abundance, distribution).

-   **Modeling Data:** Utilize climate modeling outputs to project future climate conditions and their potential effects on coastal ecosystems.

-   **Statistical Analysis:** Employ statistical techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, regression analysis) to analyze relationships between climate variables and ecosystem responses.

**Expected Outcomes:**

-   A better understanding of the specific impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems.

-   Identification of vulnerable coastal habitats and species.

-   Development of strategies for adaptation and mitigation to address climate change challenges.

-   Contribution to informed decision-making for coastal management and conservation.

**Project Timeline:**
